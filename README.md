# python
I started leaning Python as a beginner. I will be uploading source codes that I write every single day. Thank you all! 

I am doing a project in Machine Learning so I started re-learning Python and some libraries like pandas, numpy, patplotlib and others.

I am going to keep this repository updated from now on(date: 2020, Nov13)
